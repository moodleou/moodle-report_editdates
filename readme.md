## Supporting other activities

This plugin needs to know about what dates are contained in each activity or block.
This is done by code in separate classes. For some things, these classes are in
this plugin: https://github.com/moodleou/moodle-report_editdates/tree/master/mod,
https://github.com/moodleou/moodle-report_editdates/tree/master/blocks.

For other plugins, there is the option to put the class in the other plugin.
You need to make a class called `mod_`_mymodname_`_report_editdates_integration`,
which therefore goes in mod/_mymodname_/classes/report_editdates_integration.php.
For blocks, the equivalent class is `block_`_myblock_`_report_editdates_integration`.

## Available callbacks 

To be aligned with a core extension point for the activity form via core callbacks, 
this plugin allows developers to extend dates form the same way.
                           
Supported callbacks:

* report_editdates_form_elements
* report_editdates_form_definition_after_data
* report_editdates_form_validation
* report_editdates_form_post_actions
