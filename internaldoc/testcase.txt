Initial Setup
=============

You need one test course with a few activities (fewer than 20), and one test
course with many activities (more than 20), including at least one of each type.

Start with Activity completion and Conditional availability enabled in the admin menu.

Test script
===========

1.  In the small course, go to Administration -> Reports -> Dates.
2.  At the top will be an 'Activity type' selector. This should be set to 'All activities'.
3.  Then there will be a form with a section at the top for the course start date,
    and sections below for each course section that contains relevant activities.
    In each section will be all the date settings for each activity.
4.  Change some settings here, then go to the standard edit settings page for that
    activity, and ensure that the changed settings have been saved.
5.  Change some date settings in the standard activity settings from, go back to
    the edit dates report, and ensure the updated dates are shown there.
6.  Now go to the report for the large course. The report will automatically
    swtich to only show one type of activity, to stop the form from being too big.
7.  Switch through each activity type, and ensure that the date settings in the
    report have exactly the same set of date settings as in the standard
    activity settings form. Specific things to check are:
    * whether you can set time as well as date for each setting.
    * the precision, e.g. whether you can set any minutes, or just multiples of 5.
    * for settings that depend on other settings on the from, e.g. forum rating
      dates, the setting should only appear in the report if it is enabled in the
      activity settings.
    * that the disabled-if dependencies between the settings for each activity are
      the same as on the editing form.
8.  Turn off Activity completion and/or Conditional availability and ensure that
    the corresponding settings disapper in the report.
