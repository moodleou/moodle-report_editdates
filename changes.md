# Change log for the Edit dates report

## Changes in 3.0

* This version works with Moodle 4.0.
* Updated to use Moodle 3.11 navigation
* The method report_helper::save_selected_report() has been been deprecated because it is no longer used in 4.0.
  The report_helper::print_report_selector() is used to to show the dropdown, on the report page.

## Changes in 2.9

* Improved how the options are presented for forums (thanks to Matt Davidson).
* Fix a minor but in the timeline (thanks to Matt Davidson & Sam Marshall).


## Changes in 2.8

* New graphical display of the course timeline, thanks to Matt Davidson.
* Usability improvement: a message is shown at the top of the page if the form did not
  validate and so your changes are not yet saved.
* All times can now be set to the nearest minute, like in standard Moodle.
* Fix the dependency between forum assessment start and finish times.
* Memory allocation increased, which should help the report work on large courses.


## Changes in 2.7

* There is now a way for other plugins to add themselves to this report
  using a class in that other plugin, rather than requring a class to be added here.
  See the readme for details.
* Fixed a problem with the CSS, where the CSS here would alter the appearance
  of forms throughout Moodle. Sorry about that.
* Update automated tests for Moodle 3.6.


## Changes in 2.6

* Privacy API implementation.
* Added support for mod_assign gradingduedate.
* Added support for third-party mod_zoom.
* Added support for course end times, and cours start time as
  well as date (matching MDL-61205 and MDL-43648).
* Setup Travis-CI automated testing integration.
* Fix some automated tests to pass with newer versions of Moodle.
* Fix some coding style.
* Due to privacy API support, this version now only works in Moodle 3.4+
  For older Moodles, you will need to use a previous version of this plugin.
